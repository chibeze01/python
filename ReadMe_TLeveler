firstly, data gathering is quite important here we want to get economics data from
a trading website; the site I have chosen for this is trading economics. TE.com is free
and is full with trading relative data.
for this preliminary task I will be using requests, bs4 and csv-files.

take the data gathered in the csv file and do some calculations on them.
first we need a easy way to do data retrieval from the csv file.
we will use pandas for this purpose. with pandas dataframe sturcture interacting with the fields
 in the CSV file is alot simplers. in terms of selection, and modification of the table/dataframe.

we will be getting data about interest rate and GDP QOQ (quarterly growth rate of the country)

after getting the data we want to analyse we want to start thinking about the calculation.

For this I will be using a point and kill approach.
rather than doing computation for all the pair I will do computation for the most popular pairs,
and then allow the user to point out which other pair they wan to be computed.
Haskell curry would be ideal if we were to take pairs(tuple) as inputs
